==================

The Bookshelf Node.js Lab assumes familiarity with the javascript language and experience in at least one object-oriented language like Ruby, Python, PHP, or Java. If you have yet to familiarize yourself with javascript or just need to brush up, I recommend completing Code Academyâ€™s Javascript track. On average, this lab should take eight (8-10) hours to complete and is largely instructor independent.
